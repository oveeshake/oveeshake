- 👋 Hi, I’m Avishek Gupta
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding how programming can help in building a better business.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL and a little bit of Salesforce oriented Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of now because I am yet to fully understand how GitHub works.
- 📫 How to reach me ...Well, not now.
